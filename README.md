# Networked-Aframe Starter Pack

Built with [Networked-A-Frame](https://github.com/haydenjameslee/networked-aframe), a web framework for building multi-user virtual reality experiences. Works on Vive, Rift, desktop, mobile platforms.

Click and drag on desktop. Open it on a smartphone and use the device motion sensors. Or [plug in a VR headset](https://webvr.rocks)!

In this virtual app individualâ€™s can talk to their therapist virtually. In order to do this they will need to join a room by first choosing a setting, and then send the room id to the therapist so that they can join. Once they do this the room will load in with the environment chosen and both users will be in the room itself. From there, voice proximity chat will be enabled once the users give permission to allow the program to access their microphone. Now, both the user and the therapist are free to talk and look around their surroundings in the comfort of their own home while also remaining anonymous.
